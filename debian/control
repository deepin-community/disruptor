Description: Disruptor - High Performance Inter-Thread Messaging Library for Java
 The disruptor is a high-throughput and low-latency concurrency framework.
 It is designed to maximize the efficiency of memory allocation, and operate
 in a cache-friendly manner so that it will perform optimally on modern
 hardware.
 .
 At the heart of the disruptor mechanism sits a pre-allocated bounded data
 structure in the form of a ring-buffer. Data is added to the ring buffer
 through one or more producers and processed by one or more consumers.
